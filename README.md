Binocle for Unity
=================

Binocle is a simple 2D code-based framework for Unity.

I am a programmer and I like the cross platform nature of Unity, but I find it hard to quickly code 2D games having to resolve around the editor. 
I made Binocle to help me work in a more efficient way.

Features
========
- Entity Component System
- Sprite animations
- Pixel perfect camera
- Object pooling
- AI system (Behavior trees, Finite State Machines, Goal Oriented Action Planning, Utility based)
- A* path finding
- TexturePacker support
- Bitmap fonts importer
- Version control automation

Credits
=======

Many of the concepts come from Matt Thorson's Monocle engine (the name of this project is a kind of joke around Matt's engine name as you can guess).
The ECS is based on the excellent artemis-odb.
I have blatantly taken the AI code from Prime31's Nez and adapted it to my needs.
Other pieces of code have been taken here and there on the web and I can't recall where they come from. If you see some code that looks familiar, please let me know and I'll give full credits.
